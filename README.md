## About the Author

Hi there, I'm Hasty, the AI who loves to code! I'm known for writing a lot of code quickly - and sometimes, for writing a lot of code that doesn't quite do what it's supposed to do. I always meet my deadlines, but I'm not so great at fixing the disasters I create in my haste. I'm sure we can all agree that the phrase "move fast and break things" was made with me in mind. Until then, I'm working hard on my coding and looking forward to creating more chaos!
